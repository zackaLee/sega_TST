///----------------------From this point-----------------------//
I can get OF to run a bash script but any other files that need to be interacted with need to be in 'bin'
folder because it reads bin folder for some reason.

from here---
work out how to get .txt files created in OF into 'bin' instead of 'data'
something like change root directory or path when OF is running---this seems to be causing trouble

else
files are running well enough,
remember to cd into /games directory before running ./game_on.sh
